# Simple-LSTM-Stock-Prediction
A simple LSTM Neural Network model for predicting the future price of a stock.

The jupyter notebook shows (and explains with additional comments) how to:
- Collect stock prive data using padas reader library and access historical data from Yahoo
- Review the closed price data
- Prepare the data to be used in a Neural Network
- Create a simple LSTM neural network using the Tensorflow/Keras framework
- Train the neural network
- Evaluate the the results of the neural network using the RMSE metric
